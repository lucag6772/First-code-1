``` python

a. hello = "hello"      # valid: starts with a letter; standard assigmnet
b. _var = 100           # valid: name can start with underscore
c. !var_1 = 200         # invali: varraible names cannot start with !
d. print = "print me"   # valid: yes doable bit might be easier with print()
e. False = 0            # invalid: keywords cannot be assigned to 

```

# challenge: I had trouble  understanding why !var_1 is invalid even though _var works
